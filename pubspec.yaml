    - assets/images/
    - assets/books/
    - assets/2018/12/
    - assets/2019/1/
    - assets/2019/2/
    - assets/2019/3/
    - assets/2019/4/
    - assets/2019/5/
    - assets/2019/6/
    - assets/2019/7/

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.io/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.io/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
   - family: SKH_VERDANA
     fonts:
       - asset: fonts/SKH_VERDANA.ttf
       - asset: fonts/SKH_VERDANAB.ttf
         weight: 700
  #   - family: Trajan Pro
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
  #         weight: 700
